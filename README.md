# Array
## Inserting an Element in an Array
##### Inserting an element in an array refers to the operation of adding an element to the array. In the case of insertion, we assume that there is enough memory space still available in the array. For example, if we have an array that can hold 20 elements and the array contains only 15 elements, then we have space to accommodate five more elements. However, if the array can hold 15 elements, then we will not be able to insert other elements into the array. Insertion in arrays can be done in three ways: 
- Insertion at the beginnig.
    - Heading level 6
- Insertion at a specified position.
- Insertion at the end.
