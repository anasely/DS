# Array
## Inserting an Element in an Array
##### Inserting an element in an array refers to the operation of adding an element to the array. In the case of insertion, we assume that there is enough memory space still available in the array. For example, if we have an array that can hold 20 elements and the array contains only 15 elements, then we have space to accommodate five more elements. However, if the array can hold 15 elements, then we will not be able to insert other elements into the array. Insertion in arrays can be done in three ways: 
- Insertion at the beginnig.
    - In this case, the new element to be inserted is inserted at the beginning of the array. To insert an element at the beginning, all the elements stored in the array must move one place forward to vacate the first position in the array. For example, if an array is declared to hold 10 elements and it contains only seven elements, and also if it is given that the new element is to be inserted at the beginning of the array, then all the stored ele- ments must move one place ahead which is shown as follows:

- Insertion at a specified position.
- Insertion at the end.


# Linked List
## Applications of linked list 
##### Consider a polynomial 10x2 + 6x + 9. In this polynomial, every indi- vidual term consists of two parts: first, a coefficient, and second, a power. Here, the coefficients of the expression are 10, 6, and 9, and 2, 1, and 0 are the respective powers of the coefficients. Now, every individual term can be represented using a node of the linked list. The following figure shows how a polynomial expression can be represented using a linked list
